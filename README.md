# Lunar Lander Deep Q-Learning

This project implements Deep Q-Learning to solve the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for reinforcement learning
- Experience replay and target networks for stable training
- Jupyter notebook with code, explanations, and visualizations

## File

- `LunarLander_Reinforcement.ipynb`: Main notebook with all code and explanations

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions and run the cells to train and evaluate the agent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy

## Description

The agent learns to land a lunar module safely using Deep Q-Learning, with experience replay and target networks for improved stability and performance.
